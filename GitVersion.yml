# CI is only triggered on a PR / PR update / merge to master. Based on that, we only need two definitions.
# 
# master is configured as Continuous Delivery because that's the default and suitable for what we need. Each merge will increment the Patch version.
#   When we're ready to "release", we manually tag the target commit with the version we're releasing, manually trigger a build and GitVersion will figure out the rest.
# PRs are configured as Continuous Deployment so that updates to PRs get a unique version and don't conflict with existing NuGet packages.
